Procrastinot
============

This is a Google Chrome extension that helps you get things done by blocking distracting websites.

Made by Alek Zieba.

============

To use the packed extension, go to the "Extensions" settings in Google Chrome and drag "Procrastinot.crx"
into the window.  If you just try to open the file without doing this, you will get an error saying
that the extension can't be added because it's not from the store.

The extension is managed through a drop-down area from a button next to the omnibox.  The drop-down area
is "popup.html".

If someone is caught procrastinating, they are brought to "redirect.html".

In order for the Focus Timer and the website checker to be able to run, "background.html" always runs.

Each of the HTML files' respective scripts end in "_script.js".

The extension's permissions, version, description, etc. is managed in "manifest.json".

Happy reading!
