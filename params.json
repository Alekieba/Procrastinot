Not to worry, Procrastinot is here for you!\r\n\r\nProcrastinot is an extension for Google Chrome that prevents you from visiting distracting websites.  Here's how it works: you give it a list of websites, you tell the extension to either block those websites or only allow those websites, and boom, you're focused!  Whenever you try to access one of these distracting websites, Procrastinot will bring you to a redirect page with a random motivational quote from its database to get you back to work!\r\n\r\nIt also features a \"Focus Timer\", where you can set a certain amount of time for you to focus.  During this time, Procrastinot will prevent you from making distracting changes to your lists.\r\n\r\nMade by Alek Zieba.","google":"UA-40962613-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
